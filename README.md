This is my clue helper, to begin using use start/0. This will go through the options to set up the game including, how many players, which players are missing and what cards you begin with. 

When entering anything, suspect names are only their last names, weapons and rooms are the full word with no spaces. Everything is always entered lower case and followed with a period.

The clue helper records every suggestion made in the game. Any time a player cannot refute a suggestion it records that they cannot have those 3 cards. Any time a player refutes your suggestion it records which card they have. Finally any time a player refutes an opponents suggestion it records what that suggestion was. This is done because in the even an opponent cannot have 2 of those 3 cards than he has the third one. Upon solving the puzzle the results are displayed in the console and the game is reset.

If you mistype something, you can interupt the game and using restart/0, resume where you left off.
